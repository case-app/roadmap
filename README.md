# Case public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official Case public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/case-app/projects/2)

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to publish them.

The roadmap repository is for communicating Case‚Äôs roadmap. Existing issues are currently read-only.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.

- An **area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- A **case element** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current case elements, see below.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **üí¨ exploring:**
  The feature is at the idea stage. It is not yet approved.

- **üé® To design:**
  The feature is approved. It must be defined and all the material necessary for its development must be provided. Specifcations, mockups, content...

- **üõ†Ô∏è to develop:**
  Developers have all the elements to work on it. The feature contains specifications, clear tasks and materials.

- **üìÑ to document:**\
  The feature is fully implemented and requires now documentation to allow our developers to implement it into a Case project.

- **üìù Beta:**\
  A developer must be able to use the feature without anomaly. The project manager must confirm that the developed feature works well.

- **‚úÖ Ready:**\
  The feature is included in the last version of Case.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline. You'll also find an **Future** column, which is used in conjunction with the **to design** and **exploring** release phases for when no timeframe is yet available.
